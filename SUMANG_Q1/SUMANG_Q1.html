			<h2>What is COVID-19? An Overview</h2>
			<p>
				Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without<br> requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes,<br> chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.
			</p>

			<p>
				The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes<br> and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub<br> frequently and not touching your face. 
			</p>

			<p>
				The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs<br> or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
