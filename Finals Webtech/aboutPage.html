		<h2>A company that values family</h2>
		<p>Jollibee was founded by Tony Tan and his family with its humble beginnings as an Ice Cream Parlor
		 <br>which later grew into an emerging global brand. At the heart of its success is a family-oriented 
		 <br>approach to personnel management, making Jollibee one of the most admired employers in the region 
		 <br>with an Employer of the Year Award from the Personnel Management Association of the Philippines, 
		 <br>Best Employer in the Philippines Award from Hewitt Associated and a Top 20
		 <br> Employer in Asia citation from the Asian Wall Street Journal.

		<br><br>Aside from promoting a family oriented work environment, the brand’s values also reflect on their advertising
		<br>and marketing. Jollibee knows their target audience very well: the traditional family and all communication materials focus 
		<br>on the importance of family values,making Jollibee the number one family fast food chain in 
		the Philippines <br>and a growing international QSR player.</p>

		<h2><br>A Well-Loved Brand</h2>
		<p>Customer satisfaction has always been key to Jollibee’s success. Never losing sight of its goals, 
		<br>Jollibee has grown to be one of the most recognized and highly preferred brands in the Philippines. 
		<br>Now the market leader among fast food chains in the Philippines, claiming a market share that totals 
		<br>to more than half of the entire industry.</p>

		<h2><br>Great tasting products and quality systems</h2>
		<p>Jollibee’s growth is due to its delicious menu line-up – like its superior-tasting Chickenjoy, 
		<br>mouth-watering Yumburger and Champ hamburger, and deliciously satisfying Jollibee Spaghetti -ably 
		<br>complemented with creative marketing programs, and efficient manufacturing and logistics facilities. 
		<br>It is made possible by well-trained teams that work in a culture of integrity and humility, fun and family-like. 
		<br>Every Jollibee outlet welcomes customers with a clean and warm in-store environment and friendly and efficient service.

		<br><br>And it is this tried and tested formula of delivering great-tasting food, adherence to world class operating 
		<br>standards and the universal appeal of the family values the brand represents that are driving the expansion of 
		<br>Jollibee both locally and in the overseas market.</p>

		<h2><br>Widest store network in the Philippines and an emerging global player</h2>
		<p>Jollibee is the largest fast food chain in the Philippines, operating a nationwide network of more than 750 stores. 
		<br>A dominant market leader in the Philippines, Jollibee enjoys the lion’s share of the local market that is more than 
		<br>all the other multinational brands combined. The company has also embarked on an aggressive international expansion 
		<br>plan, and currently has 80 stores outside the Philippines-USA (26), Vietnam (32), Brunei (11), Jeddah (7), Qatar, 
		<br>Hong Kong, and Kuwait (1 each), firmly establishing itself as a growing international QSR player.</p>

		<h2><br>A Triumph for and of the Filipino and a source of Filipino pride.</h2>
		<p>Jollibee dedicated its continuous success to the Filipinos who have been there from the very start.

		<br>Jollibee is so well-loved everytime a new store opens, especially overseas, Filipinos always 
		<br>form long lines to the store. It is more than home for them. It is a stronghold of heritage 
		<br>and monument of Filipino pride.</p>
